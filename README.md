# Citypedia

## Introduction

This si a web visualization for cities data of US. But for now, the data is fake (generated by python scripts).

You can visit it using this link: http://mpcs53001.cs.uchicago.edu/~linxuan/ (it may not exist)

## Get data
1. If you don't have real statistics, then you can use the python scripts in database directory to generate.
2. Execute the sql scripts to create tables and import data.

## Build up
I use a bootstrap template to construct the web pages. And the backend is written by PHP, so it's very easy to build up. The entrance of this project is index.html
